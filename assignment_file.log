2021-09-21 11:55:28,956 ["Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red. —J-S-Golden", 'During an early shot of the scene where Vito Corleone returns home and his people carry him up the stairs, Marlon Brando put weights under his body on the bed as a prank, to make it harder to lift him.', 'Robert De Niro spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian language in order to play Vito Corleone. Nearly all of the dialogue that his character speaks in the film was in Sicilian.', 'In Sir Michael Caine\'s opinion, Heath Ledger beat the odds and topped Jack Nicholson\'s Joker from Batman (1989): "Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath\'s gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he\'s like a really scary psychopath. He\'s a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture." Caine bases this belief on a scene where The Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne\'s penthouse. He\'d never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed, he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines.', 'At the beginning of the film, the cameras are all positioned above eye level and mounted with wide-angle lenses to give the appearance of greater distance between the subjects. As the film progresses the cameras slip down to eye level. By the end of the film, nearly all of it is shot below eye level, in close-up and with telephoto lenses to increase the encroaching sense of claustrophobia.']
